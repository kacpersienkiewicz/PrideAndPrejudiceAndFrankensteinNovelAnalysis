Common words like the, or and will be filtered out since it's obvious those sorts of words will be plentiful. Both of these novels came out in the 1810s and come from diametrically opposed genres: a novel of manners versus proto-science fiction, so it would be interesting to see how they used language differently at a surface level. \n",

    "First, the two novels will be scraped from **Project Gutenberg**. Luckily, the site offers them in plain text form already, which skips over extracting the plain text from HTML or some other format. This means that the text can be forced into all lowercase (to avoid pride and Pride being viewed as different words), and then analyzed. Analysis will include common words, sentence length, average word length, readability, and average syllables per word."

       " 'by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising, in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration.',\n",
       " 'it was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.',\n",
       " 'she mentioned this to her friend, miss lucas.',\n",
       " '“it may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied charlotte, “to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.',\n",
       " 'if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.',\n",

       " 'bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”  “but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.',\n",
       " 'if _i_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.”  “remember, eliza, that he does not know jane’s disposition as you do.”  “but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal it, he must find it out.”  “perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.',\n",
       " 'but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.',\n",

       " 'when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.”  “your plan is a good one,” replied elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it.',\n",
       " 'but these are not jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design.',\n",

       " 'had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.”  “yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce, but with respect to any other leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”  “well,” said charlotte, “i wish jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.',\n",
       " 'happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.',\n",
       " 'if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.',\n",
       " 'they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”  “you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound.',\n",
       " 'you know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”  occupied in observing mr. bingley’s attention to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.',\n",
       " 'mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.',\n",

       " 'to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.',\n",
       " 'though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.',\n",
       " 'of this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.',\n",
       " 'he began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.',\n",
       " 'his doing so drew her notice.',\n",
       " 'it was at sir william lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.',\n",
       " '“what does mr. darcy mean,” said she to charlotte, “by listening to my conversation with colonel forster?”  “that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer.”  “but if he does it any more, i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about.',\n",

       " '“i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows.”  “you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!',\n",
       " 'if my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” on miss lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “very well; if it must be so, it must.” and gravely glancing at mr. darcy, “there is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with--‘keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and i shall keep mine to swell my song.”  her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.',\n",
       " 'after a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.',\n",
       " 'mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.',\n",
       " 'mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour, till sir william thus began:--  “what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr. darcy!',\n",
       " 'there is nothing like dancing, after all.',\n",
       " 'i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies.”  “certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”  sir william only smiled.',\n",
       " '“your friend performs delightfully,” he continued, after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group; “and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr. darcy.”  “you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir.”  “yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.',\n",
       " 'do you often dance at st. james’s?”  “never, sir.”  “do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”  “it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it.”  “you have a house in town, i conclude?”  mr. darcy bowed.',\n",
       " '“i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for i am fond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas.”  he paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,--  “my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing?',\n",
       " 'mr. darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.',\n",
       " 'you cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you.” and, taking her hand, he would have given it to mr. darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,--  “indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing.',\n",
       " 'i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”  mr. darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.',\n",
       " '“you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us for one half hour.”  “mr.',\n",
       " 'darcy is all politeness,” said elizabeth, smiling.',\n",
       " '“he is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?”  elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.',\n",
       " 'her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,--  “i can guess the subject of your reverie.”  “i should imagine not.”  “you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, i am quite of your opinion.',\n",
       " 'i was never more annoyed!',\n",
       " 'the insipidity, and yet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these people!',\n",

       " 'my mind was more agreeably engaged.',\n",
       " 'i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”  miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.',\n",
       " 'mr. darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--  “miss elizabeth bennet.”  “miss elizabeth bennet!” repeated miss bingley.',\n",
       " '“i am all astonishment.',\n",

       " 'breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth:--       /* nind “my dearest lizzie, */       “i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.',\n",
       " 'my kind friends will      not hear of my returning home till i am better.',\n",
       " 'they insist also on      my seeing mr. jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear      of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a      headache, there is not much the matter with me.',\n",
       " '“yours, etc.”  “well, my dear,” said mr. bennet, when elizabeth had read the note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr. bingley, and under your orders.”  “oh, i am not at all afraid of her dying.',\n",

       " 'as long as she stays there, it is all very well.',\n",
       " 'i would go and see her if i could have the carriage.”  elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative.',\n",
       " 'she declared her resolution.',\n",
       " '“how can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!',\n",
       " 'you will not be fit to be seen when you get there.”  “i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want.”  “is this a hint to me, lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the horses?”  “no, indeed.',\n",
       " 'i do not wish to avoid the walk.',\n",
       " 'the distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.',\n",
       " 'i shall be back by dinner.”  “i admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed mary, “but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”  “we will go as far as meryton with you,” said catherine and lydia.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.',\n",
       " '“if we make haste,” said lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may see something of captain carter, before he goes.”  in meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers’ wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.',\n",
       " 'she was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.',\n",
       " 'that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.',\n",
       " 'she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was good-humour and kindness.',\n",
       " 'mr. darcy said very little, and mr. hurst nothing at all.',\n",
       " 'the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone.',\n",
       " 'the latter was thinking only of his breakfast.',\n",
       " 'her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.',\n",
       " 'miss bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.',\n",
       " 'she was not equal, however, to much conversation; and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth silently attended her.',\n",
       " 'when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane.',\n",
       " 'the apothecary came; and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.',\n",
       " 'the advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.',\n",
       " 'when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so.',\n",
       " 'miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern at parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present.',\n",

       " 'to the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr. bingley, she could not make a very favourable answer.',\n",
       " 'jane was by no means better.',\n",
       " 'the sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards jane, when not immediately before them, restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.',\n",
       " 'their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.',\n",
       " 'his anxiety for jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.',\n",
       " 'she had very little notice from any but him.',\n",
       " 'miss bingley was engrossed by mr. darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr. hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.',\n",
       " 'when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.',\n",
       " 'her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence: she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.',\n",
       " 'mrs. hurst thought the same, and added,--  “she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.',\n",
       " 'i shall never forget her appearance this morning.',\n",
       " 'she really looked almost wild.”  “she did indeed, louisa.',\n",
       " 'i could hardly keep my countenance.',\n",
       " 'very nonsensical to come at all!',\n",
       " 'why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?',\n",
       " 'her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”  “yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, i am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.”  “your picture may be very exact, louisa,” said bingley; “but this was all lost upon me.',\n",
       " 'i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning.',\n",
       " 'her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”  “_you_ observed it, mr. darcy, i am sure,” said miss bingley; “and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition.”  “certainly not.”  “to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!',\n",
       " 'what could she mean by it?',\n",
       " 'it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.”  “it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said bingley.',\n",
       " '“i am afraid, mr. darcy,” observed miss bingley, in a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”  “not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” a short pause followed this speech, and mrs. hurst began again,--  “i have an excessive regard for jane bennet,--she is really a very sweet girl,--and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.',\n",
       " 'but with such a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no chance of it.”  “i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton?”  “yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside.”  “that is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.',\n",
       " '“if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside,” cried bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”  “but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,” replied darcy.',\n",
       " 'to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations.',\n",
       " 'with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.',\n",
       " 'she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.',\n",
       " 'on entering the drawing-room, she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay below, with a book.',\n",
       " 'mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment.',\n",
       " '“do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”  “miss eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, “despises cards.',\n",
       " 'she is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”  “i deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried elizabeth; “i am _not_ a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things.”  “in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure,” said bingley; “and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”  elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.',\n",
       " 'he immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.',\n",
       " '“and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but i am an idle fellow; and though i have not many, i have more than i ever looked into.”  elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.',\n",
       " '“i am astonished,” said miss bingley, “that my father should have left so small a collection of books.',\n",
       " 'what a delightful library you have at pemberley, mr. darcy!”  “it ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many generations.”  “and then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying books.”  “i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.”  “neglect!',\n",
       " 'i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.',\n",
       " 'charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley.”  “i wish it may.”  “but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model.',\n",
       " 'there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire.”  “with all my heart: i will buy pemberley itself, if darcy will sell it.”  “i am talking of possibilities, charles.”  “upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”  elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.',\n",
       " '“is miss darcy much grown since the spring?” said miss bingley: “will she be as tall as i am?”  “i think she will.',\n",
       " 'she is now about miss elizabeth bennet’s height, or rather taller.”  “how i long to see her again!',\n",
       " 'i never met with anybody who delighted me so much.',\n",
       " 'such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished for her age!',\n",
       " 'her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”  “it is amazing to me,” said bingley, “how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”  “all young ladies accomplished!',\n",
       " 'my dear charles, what do you mean?”  “yes, all of them, i think.',\n",
       " 'they all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses.',\n",
       " 'i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.”  “your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said darcy, “has too much truth.',\n",
       " 'the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.',\n",
       " 'i cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished.”  “nor i, i am sure,” said miss bingley.',\n",
       " '“then,” observed elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.”  “yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it.”  “oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.',\n",
       " 'a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.”  “all this she must possess,” added darcy; “and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.”  “i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.',\n",
       " 'i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”  “are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?”  “_i_ never saw such a woman.',\n",
       " '_i_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”  mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when mr. hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.',\n",
       " 'as all conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.',\n",
       " '“eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i daresay, it succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”  “undoubtedly,” replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, “there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.',\n",
       " 'whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.”  miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.',\n",
       " 'bingley urged mr. jones’s being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.',\n",
       " 'this she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet were not decidedly better.',\n",
       " 'bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.',\n",
       " 'they solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.',\n",

       " 'in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.',\n",

       " 'mrs. bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.',\n",
       " 'had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield.',\n",

       " '“i am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with.',\n",

       " 'it must be an amusing study.”  “yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.',\n",
       " 'they have at least that advantage.”  “the country,” said darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.',\n",
       " 'in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.”  “but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.”  “yes, indeed,” cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.',\n",
       " '“i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.”  everybody was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.',\n",

       " 'to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.',\n",
       " 'it was over at last, however.',\n",
       " 'the gentlemen did approach: and when mr. wickham walked into the room, elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.',\n",
       " 'the officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but mr, wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.',\n",
       " '[illustration:  “the officers of the ----shire”  [_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]  mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.',\n",
       " 'with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the officers, mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.',\n",
       " 'when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her, in return, by sitting down to whist.',\n",
       " '“i know little of the game at present,” said he, “but i shall be glad to improve myself; for in my situation of life----” mrs. philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.',\n",
       " 'mr. wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia.',\n",
       " 'at first there seemed danger of lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.',\n",
       " 'allowing for the common demands of the game, mr. wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy.',\n",
       " 'she dared not even mention that gentleman.',\n",
       " 'her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved.',\n",
       " 'mr. wickham began the subject himself.',\n",
       " 'he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there.',\n",
       " '“about a month,” said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i understand.”  “yes,” replied wickham; “his estate there is a noble one.',\n",
       " 'a clear ten thousand per annum.',\n",
       " 'you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”  elizabeth could not but look surprised.',\n",
       " '“you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.',\n",
       " 'are you much acquainted with mr. darcy?”  “as much as i ever wish to be,” cried elizabeth, warmly.',\n",
       " '“i have spent four days in the same house with him, and i think him very disagreeable.”  “i have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said wickham, “as to his being agreeable or otherwise.',\n",
       " 'i am not qualified to form one.',\n",
       " 'i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.',\n",
       " 'it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.',\n",
       " 'but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.',\n",
       " 'here you are in your own family.”  “upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except netherfield.',\n",
       " 'he is not at all liked in hertfordshire.',\n",
       " 'everybody is disgusted with his pride.',\n",
       " 'you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”  “i cannot pretend to be sorry,” said wickham, after a short interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen.',\n",
       " 'the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”  “i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.”  wickham only shook his head.',\n",
       " '“i wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.”  “i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield.',\n",
       " 'i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”  “oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr. darcy.',\n",
       " 'if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go.',\n",
       " 'we are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world--a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.',\n",
       " 'his father, miss bennet, the late mr. darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.',\n",
       " 'his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.”  elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.',\n",
       " 'mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.',\n",
       " '“it was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.',\n",
       " 'i know it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.',\n",
       " 'society, i own, is necessary to me.',\n",
       " 'i have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.',\n",
       " 'i _must_ have employment and society.',\n",
       " 'a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.',\n",
       " 'the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i was brought up for the church; and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”  “indeed!”  “yes--the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.',\n",
       " 'he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.',\n",
       " 'i cannot do justice to his kindness.',\n",
       " 'he meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.”  “good heavens!” cried elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be?',\n",
       " 'how could his will be disregarded?',\n",
       " 'why did not you seek legal redress?”  “there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.',\n",
       " 'a man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but mr. darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.',\n",
       " 'certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it.',\n",
       " 'i have a warm unguarded temper, and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.',\n",
       " 'i can recall nothing worse.',\n",
       " 'but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.”  “this is quite shocking!',\n",
       " 'he deserves to be publicly disgraced.”  “some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.',\n",
       " 'till i can forget his father, i can never defy or expose _him_.”  elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.',\n",
       " '“but what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?',\n",
       " 'what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”  “a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.',\n",
       " 'had the late mr. darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, i believe, very early in life.',\n",
       " 'he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me.”  “i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!”  after a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “i _do_ remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.',\n",
       " 'his disposition must be dreadful.”  “i will not trust myself on the subject,” replied wickham; “_i_ can hardly be just to him.”  elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!” she could have added, “a young man, too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” but she contented herself with--“and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest manner.”  “we were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.',\n",
       " '_my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr. philips, appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr. darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property.',\n",
       " 'he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.',\n",
       " 'mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father’s death, mr. darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”  “how strange!” cried elizabeth.',\n",
       " '“how abominable!',\n",
       " 'i wonder that the very pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you.',\n",
       " 'if from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty i must call it.”  “it _is_ wonderful,” replied wickham; “for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend.',\n",
       " 'it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.',\n",
       " 'but we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.”  “can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”  “yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.',\n",
       " 'family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.',\n",
       " 'not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive.',\n",
       " 'he has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.”  “what sort of a girl is miss darcy?”  he shook his head.',\n",
       " '“i wish i could call her amiable.',\n",
       " 'it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud.',\n",
       " 'as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.',\n",
       " 'but she is nothing to me now.',\n",
       " 'she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, i understand, highly accomplished.',\n",
       " 'since her father’s death her home has been london, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.”  after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--  “i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley.',\n",
       " 'how can mr. bingley, who seems good-humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?',\n",
       " 'how can they suit each other?',\n",
       " 'do you know mr. bingley?”  “not at all.”  “he is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.',\n",
       " 'he cannot know what mr. darcy is.”  “probably not; but mr. darcy can please where he chooses.',\n",
       " 'he does not want abilities.',\n",
       " 'he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.',\n",
       " 'among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.',\n",
       " 'his pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure.”  the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. philips.',\n",
       " 'the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.',\n",
       " 'it had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance; that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.',\n",
       " '“i know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.',\n",
       " 'there are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.”  mr. wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing mr. collins for a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.',\n",
       " '“lady catherine de bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a living.',\n",
       " 'i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”  “you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy.”  “no, indeed, i did not.',\n",
       " 'i knew nothing at all of lady catherine’s connections.',\n",
       " 'i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.”  “her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”  this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley.',\n",
       " 'vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.',\n",
       " '“mr.',\n",
       " 'collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”  “i believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied wickham; “i have not seen her for many years; but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.',\n",
       " 'she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.”  elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickham’s attentions.',\n",
       " 'there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody.',\n",
       " 'whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth went away with her head full of him.',\n",
       " 'she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent.',\n",
       " 'lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and mr. collins, in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.',\n",
       " '[illustration:       “delighted to see their dear friend again” ]     chapter xvii.',\n",
       " '[illustration]  elizabeth related to jane, the next day, what had passed between mr. wickham and herself.',\n",
       " 'jane listened with astonishment and concern: she knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr. bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.',\n",
       " 'the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.',\n",
       " '“they have both,” said she, “been deceived, i dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.',\n",
       " 'interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.',\n",
       " 'it is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.”  “very true, indeed; and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?',\n",
       " 'do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.”  “laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.',\n",
       " 'my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr. darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for.',\n",
       " 'it is impossible.',\n",
       " 'no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.',\n",
       " 'can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?',\n",
       " 'oh no.”  “i can much more easily believe mr. bingley’s being imposed on than that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.',\n",
       " 'if it be not so, let mr. darcy contradict it.',\n",

       " 'one does not know what to think.”  “i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”  but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr. bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.',\n",
       " 'the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was fixed for the following tuesday.',\n",
       " 'the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.',\n",

       " 'jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr. wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr. darcy’s look and behaviour.',\n",
       " 'the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.',\n",

       " 'but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and, having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.',\n",
       " 'the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress: they were dances of mortification.',\n",
       " 'mr. collins, awkward and solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.',\n",
       " 'the moment of her release from him was ecstasy.',\n",
       " 'she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.',\n",
       " 'when those dances were over, she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.',\n",
       " 'he walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind: charlotte tried to console her.',\n",
       " '“i dare say you will find him very agreeable.”  “heaven forbid!',\n",
       " '_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!',\n",
       " 'to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!',\n",
       " 'do not wish me such an evil.”  when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy, and reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.',\n",
       " 'they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.',\n",
       " 'he replied, and was again silent.',\n",
       " 'after a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time, with--  “it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr. darcy.',\n",
       " '_i_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.”  he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.',\n",
       " '“very well; that reply will do for the present.',\n",
       " 'perhaps, by-and-by, i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but _now_ we may be silent.”  “do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”  “sometimes.',\n",
       " 'one must speak a little, you know.',\n",
       " 'it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.”  “are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?”  “both,” replied elizabeth archly; “for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.',\n",
       " 'we are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”  “this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,” said he.',\n",
       " '“how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say.',\n",
       " '_you_ think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”  “i must not decide on my own performance.”  he made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton.',\n",
       " 'she answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist the temptation, added, “when you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.”  the effect was immediate.',\n",
       " 'a deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his features, but he said not a word; and elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.',\n",
       " 'at length darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,--  “mr.',\n",
       " 'wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain.”  “he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied elizabeth, with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.”  darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.',\n",
       " 'at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving mr. darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.',\n",
       " '“i have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very superior dancing is not often seen.',\n",
       " 'it is evident that you belong to the first circles.',\n",
       " 'allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you: and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza (glancing at her sister and bingley), shall take place.',\n",
       " 'what congratulations will then flow in!',\n",
       " 'i appeal to mr. darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.',\n",
       " 'you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”  [illustration:  “such very superior dancing is not often seen.”  [_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]  the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir william’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards bingley and jane, who were dancing together.',\n",
       " 'recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,--  “sir william’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.”  “i do not think we were speaking at all.',\n",
       " 'sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.',\n",
       " 'we have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine.”  “what think you of books?” said he, smiling.',\n",
       " '“books--oh no!--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.”  “i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.',\n",
       " 'we may compare our different opinions.”  “no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.”  “the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he, with a look of doubt.',\n",
       " '“yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy, that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was unappeasable.',\n",
       " 'you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being created_?”  “i am,” said he, with a firm voice.',\n",
       " '“and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”  “i hope not.”  “it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.”  “may i ask to what these questions tend?”  “merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.',\n",
       " '“i am trying to make it out.”  “and what is your success?”  she shook her head.',\n",
       " '“i do not get on at all.',\n",
       " 'i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”  “i can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”  “but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another opportunity.”  “i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.',\n",
       " 'she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for in darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.',\n",
       " 'they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and, with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--  “so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham?',\n",
       " 'your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late mr. darcy’s steward.',\n",
       " 'let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to mr. darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner.',\n",
       " 'i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.',\n",
       " 'his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it.',\n",

       " 'you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.',\n",
       " 'i arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.',\n",
       " 'i am already far north of london, and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh, i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.',\n",
       " 'do you understand this feeling?',\n",
       " 'this breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.',\n",
       " 'inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid.',\n",
       " 'i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.',\n",
       " 'there, margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.',\n",
       " 'there—for with your leave, my sister, i will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.',\n",
       " 'its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.',\n",
       " 'what may not be expected in a country of eternal light?',\n",
       " 'i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.',\n",
       " 'i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.',\n",
       " 'these are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river.',\n",
       " 'but supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.',\n",
       " 'these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter, and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.',\n",
       " 'this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.',\n",
       " 'i have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean through the seas which surround the pole.',\n",
       " 'you may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle thomas’ library.',\n",
       " 'my education was neglected, yet i was passionately fond of reading.',\n",
       " 'these volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.',\n",
       " 'these visions faded when i perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.',\n",
       " 'i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated.',\n",

       " 'i commenced by inuring my body to hardship.',\n",
       " 'i accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the north sea; i voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.',\n",
       " 'twice i actually hired myself as an under-mate in a greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.',\n",
       " 'i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.',\n",
       " 'and now, dear margaret, do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?',\n",
       " 'my life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path.',\n",
       " 'oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative!',\n",
       " 'my courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.',\n",
       " 'i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: i am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.',\n",
       " 'this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia.',\n",
       " 'they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach.',\n",
       " 'the cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which i have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.',\n",
       " 'i have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between st. petersburgh and archangel.',\n",
       " 'i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing.',\n",
       " 'i do not intend to sail until the month of june; and when shall i return?',\n",
       " 'ah, dear sister, how can i answer this question?',\n",

       " 'i shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.',\n",

       " 'you may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but i bitterly feel the want of a friend.',\n",

       " 'i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.',\n",
       " 'but it is a still greater evil to me that i am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas’ books of voyages.',\n",
       " 'at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country.',\n",
       " 'now i am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.',\n",
       " 'it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) _keeping;_ and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.',\n",
       " 'well, these are useless complaints; i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in archangel, among merchants and seamen.',\n",
       " 'yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms.',\n",
       " 'my lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession.',\n",
       " 'he is an englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity.',\n",
       " 'i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, i easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.',\n",
       " 'the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.',\n",
       " 'this circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him.',\n",
       " 'a youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: i have never believed it to be necessary, and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.',\n",
       " 'i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.',\n",
       " 'this, briefly, is his story.',\n",
       " 'some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.',\n",
       " 'he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union.',\n",
       " 'my generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit.',\n",
       " 'he had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.',\n",
       " 'but the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.',\n",
       " '“what a noble fellow!” you will exclaim.',\n",
       " 'he is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.',\n",
       " 'yet do not suppose, because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know, that i am wavering in my resolutions.',\n",
       " 'those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.',\n",
       " 'the winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected.',\n",
       " 'i shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.',\n",
       " 'i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.',\n",
       " 'it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which i am preparing to depart.',\n",
       " 'i am going to unexplored regions, to “the land of mist and snow,” but i shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and woeful as the “ancient mariner.” you will smile at my allusion, but i will disclose a secret.',\n",

       " 'there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand.',\n",
       " 'i am practically industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore.',\n",

       " 'so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.',\n",
       " 'last monday (july 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated.',\n",
       " 'our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog.',\n",
       " 'we accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.',\n",
       " 'about two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end.',\n",
       " 'some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation.',\n",
       " 'we perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.',\n",
       " 'we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.',\n",
       " 'this appearance excited our unqualified wonder.',\n",
       " 'we were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed.',\n",
       " 'shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.',\n",
       " 'about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.',\n",
       " 'we, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice.',\n",
       " 'i profited of this time to rest for a few hours.',\n",
       " 'in the morning, however, as soon as it was light, i went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea.',\n",
       " 'it was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice.',\n",
       " 'only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.',\n",
       " 'he was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a european.',\n",
       " 'when i appeared on deck the master said, “here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.”  on perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in english, although with a foreign accent.',\n",
       " '“before i come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”  you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.',\n",
       " 'i replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.',\n",
       " 'upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.',\n",
       " 'good god!',\n",
       " 'margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.',\n",
       " 'his limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.',\n",
       " 'i never saw a man in so wretched a condition.',\n",
       " 'we attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted.',\n",
       " 'we accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.',\n",
       " 'as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove.',\n",
       " 'by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.',\n",
       " 'two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and i often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.',\n",
       " 'when he had in some measure recovered, i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit.',\n",
       " 'i never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled.',\n",
       " 'but he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.',\n",
       " 'when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.',\n",
       " 'once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.',\n",
       " 'his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, “to seek one who fled from me.”  “and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”  “yes.”  “then i fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”  this aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued.',\n",
       " 'soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “i have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”  “certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”  “and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”  soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.',\n",
       " 'i replied that i could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this i could not judge.',\n",
       " 'from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.',\n",
       " 'he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but i have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.',\n",
       " 'i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.',\n",
       " 'such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day.',\n",
       " 'the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.',\n",
       " 'yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him.',\n",
       " 'for my own part, i begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.',\n",
       " 'he must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.',\n",
       " 'i said in one of my letters, my dear margaret, that i should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet i have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.',\n",
       " 'i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should i have any fresh incidents to record.',\n",
       " 'august 13th, 17—.',\n",
       " 'my affection for my guest increases every day.',\n",
       " 'he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.',\n",
       " 'how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?',\n",
       " 'he is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.',\n",
       " 'he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.',\n",
       " 'yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others.',\n",
       " 'he has frequently conversed with me on mine, which i have communicated to him without disguise.',\n",
       " 'he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it.',\n",
       " 'i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise.',\n",
       " 'one man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought, for the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.',\n",
       " 'as i spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance.',\n",
       " 'at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast.',\n",
       " 'i paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “unhappy man!',\n",
       " 'do you share my madness?',\n",
       " 'have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?',\n",
       " 'hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”  such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.',\n",
       " 'having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.',\n",
       " 'he asked me the history of my earlier years.',\n",
       " 'the tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection.',\n",
       " 'i spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.',\n",
       " '“i agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.',\n",
       " 'i once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship.',\n",
       " 'you have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair.',\n",
       " 'but i—i have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.”  as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart.',\n",
       " 'but he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.',\n",
       " 'even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature.',\n",
       " 'the starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.',\n",
       " 'such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.',\n",
       " 'will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine wanderer?',\n",
       " 'you would not if you saw him.',\n",
       " 'you have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.',\n",
       " 'sometimes i have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew.',\n",
       " 'i believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.',\n",
       " 'august 19th, 17—.',\n",
       " 'yesterday the stranger said to me, “you may easily perceive, captain walton, that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.',\n",
       " 'i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination.',\n",
       " 'you seek for knowledge and wisdom, as i once did; and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.',\n",
       " 'i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am, i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.',\n",
       " 'prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.',\n",
       " 'were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”  you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication, yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes.',\n",
       " 'i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.',\n",
       " 'i expressed these feelings in my answer.',\n",
       " '“i thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.',\n",
       " 'i wait but for one event, and then i shall repose in peace.',\n",
       " 'i understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that i wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.”  he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure.',\n",
       " 'this promise drew from me the warmest thanks.',\n",
       " 'i have resolved every night, when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day.',\n",
       " 'if i should be engaged, i will at least make notes.',\n",
       " 'this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day!',\n",
       " 'even now, as i commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; i see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.',\n",

       " 'one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.',\n",

       " 'but when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.',\n",
       " 'beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant’s house.',\n",
       " 'the interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.',\n",
       " 'his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support.',\n",

       " 'there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.',\n",
       " 'there was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly.',\n",
       " 'perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth.',\n",
       " 'there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.',\n",
       " 'everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.',\n",

       " 'they penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places.',\n",
       " 'they ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.',\n",
       " 'they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”  such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me.',\n",
       " 'as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose.',\n",
       " 'so much has been done, exclaimed the soul of frankenstein—more, far more, will i achieve; treading in the steps already marked, i will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.',\n",

       " 'he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus, but without the contempt that m. krempe had exhibited.',\n",

       " 'the labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” i listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; i expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours.',\n",
       " 'i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure.',\n",
       " '“i am happy,” said m. waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, i have no doubt of your success.',\n",

       " 'if your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”  he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what i ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.',\n",

       " 'yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.',\n",
       " 'she was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.',\n",
       " 'when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.',\n",
       " 'a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.',\n",
       " 'the trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called.',\n",
       " 'several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as i had.',\n",
       " 'she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.',\n",

       " 'she returned to the house about eight o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him.',\n",
       " 'when shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.',\n",
       " 'the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.',\n",
       " 'justine was called on for her defence.',\n",
       " 'as the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered.',\n",
       " 'surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed.',\n",
       " 'sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.',\n",

       " 'but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.”  she then related that, by the permission of elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at chêne, a village situated at about a league from geneva.',\n",
       " 'on her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.',\n",
       " 'she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.',\n",
       " 'most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.',\n",

       " 'if she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.',\n",
       " 'that she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain.',\n",
       " 'concerning the picture she could give no account.',\n",
       " '“i know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but i have no power of explaining it; and when i have expressed my utter ignorance, i am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket.',\n",
       " 'but here also i am checked.',\n",

       " 'i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, i must be condemned, although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence.”  several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.',\n",
       " 'elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court.',\n",

    "A preliminary analysis shows a general difference in tone and outlook. For example, *Pride and Prejudice* contains honorifics like Mr., Mrs. and lady amongst the most common words as well as names such as Elizabeth, Darcy, and Bennet. On the other hand, *Frankenstein* has the general terms one, father, and man as more common than specific names. This is not to see there are no clear similiarities. Both include could, would, may, much, and shall in the most used words lists. These are likely common words for the time period that happened to not be stop words in NLTK's stopwords method. There is an argument to be made that the popularity of must, much, may, might and of honorifics, titles, and names corroborates the fact that *Pride and Prejudice* is a book of manners; likewise the commonplace impersonal words like one and man corroborates the fact that *Frankenstein* is a philosophical proto-science fiction text ( this is furthered by the popularity of life,death, mind and feelings).\n",
